\section{MariaDB}
 
MariaDB is a popular open source relational database created by the
original developers of MySQL and was developed as an alternative to
MySQL. Michael "Monty" Widenius is the lead developer of MariaDB and
also the founder of MySQL AB \cite{wiki-MariaDB}. It supports a broad
set of use cases by using different storage engines for different use
cases. These pluggable storage engines make it flexible, robust and
scalable \cite{mariadb-server}. “It includes XtraDB storage engine for
replacing InnoDB, as well as a new storage engine, Aria, that intends
to be both a transactional and non-transactional engine”
\cite{wiki-MariaDB}. It intends to maintain compatibility with
MySQL\cite{wiki-MariaDB}, yet provide “a rich ecosystem of storage
engines, plugins and many other tools to make it very versatile for a
wide variety of use cases” \cite{www-mariadb-org}. It is used to turn
data into structured information for a wide variety of applications,
ranging from banking to websites. The later versions of MariaDB
support GIS and JSON format \cite{www-mariabdb-org}. “MariaDB is
secure at the enterprise-level, highly reliable and trusted by the
world’s leading brands” \cite{about-mariadb}. It is used to support
enterprise needs from OLTP to analytics \cite{about-mariadb}.
