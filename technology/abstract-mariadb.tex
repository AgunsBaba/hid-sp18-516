\section{MariaDB}
 
MariaDB is a popular open source relational database created by the
original developers of MySQL and was developed as an alternative to
MySQL. Michael ``Monty'' Widenius is the lead developer of MariaDB and
also the founder of MySQL AB ~\cite{hid-sp18-516-wiki-mariadb}. It supports a broad
set of use cases by using different storage engines for different use
cases. These pluggable storage engines make it flexible, robust and
scalable ~\cite{hid-sp18-516-mariadb-server}. ``It includes XtraDB storage engine for
replacing InnoDB, as well as a new storage engine, Aria, that intends
to be both a transactional and non-transactional engine''
~\cite{hid-sp18-516-wiki-mariadb}. It intends to maintain compatibility with
MySQL~\cite{hid-sp18-516-wiki-mariadb}, yet provide ``a rich ecosystem of storage
engines, plugins and many other tools to make it very versatile for a
wide variety of use cases''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-mariadb-foundation}. It is used to turn
data into structured information for a wide variety of applications,
ranging from banking to websites. The later versions of MariaDB
support GIS and JSON format~\cite{hid-sp18-516-mariadb-foundation}. ``MariaDB is
secure at the enterprise-level, highly reliable and trusted by the
world's leading brands''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-mariadb}. It is used to support
enterprise needs from OLTP to analytics~\cite{hid-sp18-516-mariadb}.
