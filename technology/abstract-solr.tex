Apache Solr is a fast, open-source search platform used
to build search applications. It leverages the power of Apache
Lucene, which is a Java-based search library providing the core
operations required by any search application like Indexing and
Searching~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-tutorialspoint-solr}. Apache Lucene and Apache
Solr were merged together in 2010 and since then, produced by the Apache
Software Foundation development team. It has an active development community and
regular releases. Solr has RESTful API's like HTTP/XML or JSON to
communicate with it that can be used from most popular programming
languages~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-solr}. It has all capabilities required
for a full-text search server such as tokens, spell check, wildcard, phrases and
auto-complete. It is highly scalable, reliable, fault-tolerant and
enterprise-ready and can be deployed in any kind of systems such as standalone,
distributed or cloud~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-tutorialspoint-solr}. Other major
features include hit highlighting, built-in security, distributed search through
sharding, database integration, faceted search, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)
handling~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-solr}. As Hadoop can handle large amounts
of data, Solr can be used with Hadoop to find the required information from a
large source. Apart from search, Solr also has NoSQL features and it can be used
as a non-relational data storage and processing technology. The components of
Solr can be customized easily by extending and configuring its Java classes
thereby making it flexible and
extensible~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-tutorialspoint-solr}. Solr provides navigation
features to world's largest internet sites like Netflix, Instagram, Best Buy,
eBay etc.~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-apacheorg-solr}. It is packaged as the built-in
search in many applications such as content management systems and enterprise
content management systems~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wiki-solr}.
