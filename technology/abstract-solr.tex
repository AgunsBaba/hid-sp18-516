\section{Apache Solr}

Apache Solr is a fast, open-source search platform used to build search
applications. It leverages the power of Apache Lucene, which is a Java-based
search library providing the core operations required by any search application
like Indexing and Searching~\cite{hid-sp18-516-tutorialspoint-solr}. Solr runs
as a standalone full-text search server and ``has REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON
APIs that make it usable from most popular programming
languages''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-wiki-solr}. ``Its major features include
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic
clustering, database integration, NoSQL features and rich document (e.g., Word,
PDF) handling''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-wiki-solr}. It is highly scalable,
fault-tolerant and enterprise ready and can be deployed in any kind of systems
such as standalone, distributed or cloud. As Hadoop can handle large amounts of
data, Solr can also be used with Hadoop to find the required information from a
large source. Apart from search, Solr can also be used for storage
purposes~\cite{hid-sp18-516-tutorialspoint-solr}. ``Solr powers the search and
navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites'' like
Netflix, Instagram, Best Buy, eBay etc.~\cite{hid-sp18-516-apacheorg-solr}. Solr
is packaged as the built-in search in many applications such as content
management systems and enterprise content management 
systems~\cite{hid-sp18-516-wiki-solr}.
