\section{Lingual}

Lingual is a free, open source project that was designed to build Big Data
applications on Apache Hadoop easily and quickly. It leverages the platform
support of Cascading, an ``application framework for building robust, enterprise
Big Data applications on Hadoop''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-drivenio-lingual}. Lingual
provides a true ANSI-standard SQL interface, thereby ``allowing SQL users to
utilize existing skills to create and run Big Data applications on Hadoop''
without any new training~\cite{hid-sp18-516-drivenio-lingual}. It also provides
a JDBC driver, that ``enables integration with many existing BI tools and
application servers''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-cascading}. It allows to ``export data
from Hadoop directly into traditional BI tools and other critical
applications''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-cascading}. It ``is compatible with all major
Hadoop distributions whether on-premise or in the
cloud''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-drivenio-lingual}. It overcomes the barriers of
integrating Hadoop with the existing data management systems by allowing
``analysts and developers, familiar with SQL, JDBC or traditional BI tools'' to
instantly and easily create and run big data applications on
Hadoop~\cite{hid-sp18-516-drivenio-lingual}.
