TokuDB is an open-source storage engine for MySQL and MariaDB used in high-
performance and write-intensive environments. It uses fractal-tree index 
technology which enables it to offer better performance, and increased compression. 
This makes it scalable and improves operational efficiency. It is ACID and MVCC 
compliant and offers online schema-modifications. It is also included in Percona 
server~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wikipedia}. It ``reduces the deployment costs associated with 
scaling and optimization efforts'' and is well-suited for the ``demanding requirements 
of big data applications''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-percona}. It ``provides indexing-
based query improvements and reduces slave lag for both hard disk drives and flash 
memory''~\cite{hid-sp18-516-www-wikipedia}. ``Because of its exceptional indexing performance, 
TokuDB is ideal for applications that must simultaneously query and update large 
volumes of rapidly arriving data'' without having to change any application code
~\cite{hid-sp18-516-blackbird-si}.
